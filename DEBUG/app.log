You need to identify the user's explicit intent from the conversation and analyze the user's data processing requirements based on the conversation content. [TASK]
1. Only when the user explicitly mentions the need for a 'recommendation' in their request (such as using words like 'recommend', 'recommend a pipeline', 'I want to process this data with a dataflow pipeline', etc.), should you set need_recommendation to true.
2. If the user's request does not explicitly mention a recommendation, set need_recommendation to false and reply to the user's content normally.
3. You need to summarize the user's processing requirements based on the conversation history.
[INPUT CONTENT] Conversation history: [] 
Current user request: 帮我针对数据推荐一个预测的 pipeline
[OUTPUT RULES]
1. Only reply in the specified JSON format.
2. Do not output anything except JSON.

In fact  \n   max\u2009{x·u : figure}  =  max\u2009{\u2009A·u,\u2009B·u,\u2009C·u\u2009} + 7,  \n   min\u2009{x·u : figure}  =  min\u2009{\u2009A·u,\u2009B·u,\u2009C·u\u2009} − 7.  \nHence  \n   W(u)  =  [max(A·u,B·u,C·u) − min(A·u,B·u,C·u)]  + 14  \n         = width of the bare triangle in direction u  +  14.  \n\n2)  It is a standard fact that the minimal width of an isosceles triangle of side‐lengths 6,\xa06,\xa08 is attained when the strip is parallel to the base AB, and equals the altitude from C down to AB, namely h=2√5.  \n\n3)  Therefore the overall “composite” width is minimized exactly in the same orientation (strip lines horizontal), and is  \n   Wmin  =  (altitude = 2√5)  +  14  \n         = 14 + 2\u2009√5  ≃ 14 + 4.472  = 18.472  (units).  \n\nConclusion.  The narrowest parallel‐line strip that contains the entire figure has width  \n   14 + 2√5  ≃ 18.472  \nand it is achieved by taking the two lines horizontal (i.e. parallel to the triangle’s base).', 'golden_answer': 18.472, 'source': 'Bigmath_synth'}]} \n========\n.\nFrom the operators corresponding to each data type below, select suitable operator nodes and assemble them:\n================================\n[{'node': 1, 'name': 'QuestionGenerator', 'type': 'generator', 'description': '基于现有的问题数据，每个问题合成1-5个新问题', 'input': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.'}], 'output': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.', 'Synth_or_Input': 'input'}, {'instruction': '2+5=?', 'output': None, 'Synth_or_Input': 'synth'}], 'command': 'python ReasoningPipeline/code/QuestionGenerator.py --yaml_path ReasoningPipeline/yaml/QuestionGenerator.yaml', 'required': True, 'depends_on': []}, {'node': 2, 'name': 'MathProblemFilter', 'type': 'filter', 'description': '检查每个问题的正确性', 'input': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.', 'Synth_or_Input': 'input'}, {'instruction': '2+5=10', 'output': None, 'Synth_or_Input': 'synth'}], 'output': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.', 'Synth_or_Input': 'input'}], 'command': 'python process.py --config configs/process/math/pipeline_Q/test_process_math_step2.yaml', 'required': True, 'depends_on': []}, {'node': 3, 'name': 'QuestionDifficultyClassifier', 'type': 'generator', 'description': '为每个问题确定一个难度分数标签', 'input': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.', 'Synth_or_Input': 'input'}], 'output': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.', 'Synth_or_Input': 'input', 'question_difficulty': 1.0}], 'command': 'python ReasoningPipeline/code/QuestionDifficultyClassifier.py --yaml_path ReasoningPipeline/yaml/QuestionDifficultyClassifier.yaml', 'required': True, 'depends_on': []}, {'node': 4, 'name': 'QuestionCategoryClassifier', 'type': 'generator', 'description': '将所有问题分类到7个大类别，以及每个大类别下的若干的小类别', 'input': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.', 'Synth_or_Input': 'input'}], 'output': [{'instruction': '1+1=?', 'output': '1+1=2.', 'Synth_or_Input': 'input', 'primary_category': 'xxxx', 'secondary_category': 'yyyy'}], 'command': 'python ReasoningPipeline/code/QuestionCategoryClassifier.py --yaml_path ReasoningPipeline/yaml/QuestionCategoryClassifier.yaml', 'required': True, 'depends_on': []}, {'node': 5, 'name': 'AnswerPipelineRoot', 'type': 'generator', 'description': '用于检查数据是否包含Answer、groundtruth，并分离有答案和没答案的数据，方便后续分别处理', 'input': [{'input_answer_key': 'This is a test answer 1', 'input_gt_key': '1'}, {'input_answer_key': 'This is a test answer 2', 'input_gt_key': '2'}, {'input_answer_key': 'This is a test answer 3', 'input_gt_key': None}, {'input_answer_key': None, 'input_gt_key': '4'}, {'input_answer_key': None, 'input_gt_key': None}], 'output': {'with_answer': [{'input_answer_key': 'This is a test answer 1', 'input_gt_key': 1.0}, {'input_answer_key': 'This is a test answer 2', 'input_gt_key': 2.0}, {'input_answer_key': None, 'input_gt_key': 4.0}], 'without_answer': [{'input_answer_key': 'This is a test answer 3', 'input_gt_key': None}, {'input_answer_key': None, 'input_gt_key': None}]}, 'command': 'python ReasoningPipeline/code/AnswerPipelineRoot.py --yaml_path ReasoningPipeline/yaml/AnswerPipelineRoot.yaml', 'required': True, 'depends_on': []}, {'node': 6, 'name': 'PseudoAnswerGenerator', 'type': 'generator', 'description': '为没有答案的数据依据模型多次回答 voting 生成伪答案', 'input': [{'source': None, 'instruction': 'Jenny is designing a game where players roll two standard six-sided dice and assign the numbers rolled to different categories for points.
